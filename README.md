# ddpg_env

Inital version.  Currently runs DDPG using Keras/Tensorflow using ROS and Turtlebot3.  

The code is based on: https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_machine_learning

The changes made are to use DDPG instead of DPG for the reenforcment algorithm.  The environment manipulator was also rewritten in C++ using boost python.
